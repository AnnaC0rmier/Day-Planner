<Day-Planner>


## Description

As a Developer, I wanted to create an interactive calander that users can keep track of their daily schedules on.
When the user goes to my webpage they are able to enter events in by time slot, save those events, and revisit the page at anytime of the day to check the schedule.

## Technology Used

This project included starter code (HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP) which i slightly modified to fit my own asthetics. I wrote all of the JavaScript and utalized JQuery as well as
DayJS
